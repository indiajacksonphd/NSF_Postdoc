# HTML Dump Directory

This directory contains full HTML exports of JSOC recordset queries, each corresponding to dates selected from NOAAâ€™s SEP Event List. These files serve as archived records of the original data queries used to retrieve flare-related solar image sequences.

## Purpose

The included HTML files provide reproducibility and traceability for solar image downloads from JSOC, ensuring that each query can be reviewed or re-run if needed.

## Dates Represented

The following dates were chosen due to heightened solar flare activity reported in the NOAA SEP Event List:

- January 7, 2014
- February 20, 2014
- February 25, 2014
- April 18, 2014
- September 10, 2014

These queries form the basis for all Level 1 FITS downloads used in this project.
