    "## Fetching Solar Event Metadata from Helioviewer (HEK and DONKI)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how solar event metadata is programmatically retrieved from the Helioviewer API using time-stamped observations of solar activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of event catalogs are available through the Helioviewer system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HEK (Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase):** A well-established NASA archive that catalogs solar events such as flares, active regions, and coronal mass ejections, primarily annotated by expert scientists and automated pipelines.\n",
    "- **DONKI (Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information):** A real-time event catalog produced by the NASA CCMC (Community Coordinated Modeling Center), which includes operational alerts and model-driven forecasts for solar activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, **only the HEK metadata is used** to label and describe the solar images and to generate bounding boxes for flare-related activity. This decision is based on HEK’s consistency, scientific reliability, and widespread usage in heliophysics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DONKI data is retained** and saved alongside the FITS and HEK-derived annotations for potential **future use**. This allows flexibility for:\n",
    "- Comparative analysis with model-based events,\n",
    "- Exploration of operational forecasting potential,\n",
    "- Reuse by other researchers interested in real-time alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets are queried using short time windows (default: 15 minutes) centered on each FITS image’s timestamp. Metadata is saved locally in JSON format for transparency, reproducibility, and long-term archival.\n"

    "## FITS File Processing and ASDF Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_fits_info` function is responsible for parsing raw FITS files and converting them into a structured, analysis-ready format. It plays a central role in preparing solar image data for downstream machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Function Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filename Parsing & FITS Loading**: Each FITS file is opened and verified using `astropy.io.fits`. The function automatically selects the appropriate HDU for processing (either primary or secondary based on availability of image data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timestamp Extraction**: The observation timestamp is extracted from the FITS header using `T_OBS`, `DATE-OBS`, or `TIME-OBS` keywords. This timestamp is critical for time-based querying of solar event data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Path Construction**: A unique path is constructed using the instrument name, wavelength, and timestamp, which is used to logically organize data and generate S3-style URLs for metadata purposes (even though everything is saved locally).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Header & Data Conversion**:\n",
    "  - The FITS header is converted to both `.json` and `.txt` formats.\n",
    "  - The image data is saved in `.csv` and `.npy` formats for tabular and binary use cases.\n",
    "  - All outputs are saved under `final_fits_1/fits/{header|data}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Generation**:\n",
    "  - A log-scaled, grayscale-stretched version of the FITS image is generated and saved as `.png` and `.jp2`.\n",
    "  - This aids both visualization and ML preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event Metadata Extraction**:\n",
    "  - HEK (Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase) data is retrieved based on the observation time and saved as JSON files.\n",
    "  - DONKI data retrieval is commented out for this study but can be enabled for future analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ASDF File Creation**:\n",
    "  - The processed FITS data, HEK event metadata, image paths, and pre-assigned image labels are passed to the `build_and_save_asdf` function to generate a complete, portable `.asdf` archive.\n",
    "  - These ASDF files include all critical solar observation and annotation information for each image, suitable for model training or further scientific analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Storage**: All outputs—including headers, data, images, HEK metadata, and ASDF files—are saved locally to directories under `final_fits_1/`, without uploading to S3 during this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is a core utility for transforming observational solar physics data into a unified, structured, and AI/ML-ready format.\n"

    "## Batch Processing of Local FITS Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_local_fits_directory` function serves as the main entry point for initiating batch processing of all FITS files stored locally in a specified directory. It prepares the necessary inputs and passes them to the `process_fits_info` function for full pipeline execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This function scans a local directory for `.fits` files and orchestrates the processing of each file through the FITS-to-ASDF pipeline. While the function includes references to S3-compatible paths (to simulate cloud-based organization), all operations are performed and stored locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directory Scanning**: It automatically detects and lists all `.fits` files in the specified directory.\n",
    "- **Validation**: If no FITS files are found, the function halts and prints a warning.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Configuration**:\n",
    "  - Chooses the appropriate mock S3 bucket name (`helioconvert-sdo` or `helioconvert-soho`) based on the selected spacecraft.\n",
    "  - Accepts instrument, wavelength, and optional detector information to construct the appropriate processing pipeline.\n",
    "- **Pipeline Trigger**: Once the file list is prepared, it calls the `process_fits_info` function, which performs:\n",
    "  - Header and data extraction\n",
    "  - Image generation\n",
    "  - HEK event querying\n",
    "  - ASDF archive creation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "No actual uploading to Amazon S3 occurs in this stage. Bucket names are used to maintain consistency in file naming, organization, and potential future migration to cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function allows for streamlined, large-scale data ingestion and transformation for any directory of pre-renamed FITS files.\n"
